# shopify-image-repo

This is my submission to the Shopify Developer Intern Challenge for Fall 2021. The app is a basic image repo, with functionality to upload images and liking the photos.

This project is built using the MERN stack. The images are stored on a public GCP bucket, and a Cloudflare Worker is used as a CDN to serve the images. The frontend React components are from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).
